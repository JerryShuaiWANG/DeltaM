# DeltaM
# For Automated Delta (Machine) learning (developed in Windows system)  

This is for automated generating features for small organic molcules (in SMILES format) provisionally.  

Directly run Qsar_feature_generating in Python environment is fine.  

HOF.csv is an example input file with low-level and high-level results with their correlated representations (SMILES).  

The last step (write all the features into a .csv file) is a bit time-consuming, please wait patiently.
